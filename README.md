# Advent of code 2022
This repository contains the solution code written in the C programming language for each day of the [advent of code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/).

Don't worry if you don't understand some of the perfectly crafted lines of the code. I am really enjoying the shenanigans I can do within the C and the code readability reflects it.

Although I tried handling the obvious memory leaks in the code, I haven't bothered running the code through the address sanitizer... :).
